Installation Steps

Open Termux and paste the following command to install the required scripts and dependencies:

mkdir -p ~/bin && \
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrDelin/Youtube-Downloader-Android/master/termux-url-opener | sed '1s|^.*$|#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash|' > ~/bin/termux-url-opener && \
chmod +x ~/bin/termux-url-opener && \
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrDelin/Youtube-Downloader-Android/master/refresh.sh | sed '1s|^.*$|#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash|' > ~/refresh.sh && \
chmod +x ~/refresh.sh && \
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrDelin/Youtube-Downloader-Android/master/updater.py > ~/updater.py && \
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel && \
python3 -m pip install requests

Additional Setup

If you haven't already, allow Termux access to your device's storage:

termux-setup-storage

This will prompt you to allow storage permissions. Accept them.

How to Use

1. Open the YouTube app (or another media platform like TikTok).


2. Tap Share on the video or channel you want to download.


3. Tap More.


4. Select Termux from the list.


5. The script will automatically begin downloading the media.

Where Are the Files Saved?

Downloaded files are stored in a folder named Termux_Downloader in shared internal storage, not in the default Downloads folder.

Inside Termux_Downloader, videos are organized by the media platform they were downloaded from. For example:

Termux_Downloader/youtube/

Termux_Downloader/TikTok/

Downloading Entire Channels

To download an entire channel:

1. Go to the channel page in the YouTube app.


2. Tap Share.


3. Tap More and select Termux.


4. The downloader will begin fetching all videos from that channel.

That's it! You now have a working YouTube (and multi-site) downloader integrated with Termux's share menu.
