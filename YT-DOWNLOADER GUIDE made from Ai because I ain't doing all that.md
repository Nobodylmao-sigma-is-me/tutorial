3. Tap More and select Termux.


4. The downloader interface will pop up with four options:



Menu Options When Sharing a Link

1. Best (Shortcut: b)

Automatically chooses the best quality audio+video.

Ideal for users who just want the highest quality without extra steps.


2. Advanced (Shortcut: m)

Shows a green list of available formats.

Each green line contains an ID, encoding details, and media type.

Type the ID to select a format.

Useful if you want to choose specific quality or encoding.

Caution: Not beginner-friendly due to technical jargon.


Legend:

video only = has video and audio (despite the name)

audio only = audio track only


3. Audio (Shortcut: a)

Lets you choose audio-only download.

After choosing, it asks what format to convert to (e.g., mp3, m4a).

Tip: mp3 offers best compression and cross-platform support.


Works on many platforms, not just YouTube.


4. Video (Shortcut: v)

Lets you choose resolution for video (e.g., 1080p, 720p, 480p, etc.).

Works for single videos, playlists, and full channels.


Subtitle Options (All Modes)
